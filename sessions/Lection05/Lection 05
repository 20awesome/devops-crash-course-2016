Open a text editor (such as wordpad) and paste the entire body of each certificate into one text file in the following order:

The Primary Certificate - your_domain_name.crt
The Intermediate Certificate - DigiCertCA.crt
The Root Certificate - TrustedRoot.crt
Make sure to include the beginning and end tags on each certificate. The result should look like this:

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- 
(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt) 
-----END CERTIFICATE----- 


-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- 
(Your Intermediate certificate: DigiCertCA.crt) 
-----END CERTIFICATE----- 


-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- 
(Your Root certificate: TrustedRoot.crt) 
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
