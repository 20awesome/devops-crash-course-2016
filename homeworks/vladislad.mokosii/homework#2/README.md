TCP window size and the round trip latency you can calculate the maximum possible throughput of a data transfer between two hosts

Bandwidth-in-bits-per-second * Round-trip-latency-in-seconds = TCP window size in bits / 8 = TCP window size in bytes

- Server IP - 52.42.37.206


TCP window size = 1724 KB
