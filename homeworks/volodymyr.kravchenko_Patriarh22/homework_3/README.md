1. Block access to folder /home/ubuntu/vlad_dir
  - sudo useradd vlad
  - sudo mkdir /home/vlad/.ssh
  - sudo nano autorized_keys (add Vlad ssh key)
  - deleted ssh key from /home/ubuntu/.ssh/autorized_keys
  - now access to server vlad@52.58.239.131

2. File outside home dir: /etc/init.d/touched
        It's directory where all the traditional sysvinit scripts and the backward compatible scripts for upstart live. The backward compatible scripts basically run service myservice start instead of doing anything themselves. Some just show a notice to use the "service" command
