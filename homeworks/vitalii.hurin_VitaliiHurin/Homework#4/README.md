Image sizes

The size of first image (vitaliihurin/devops-nginx-from-alotlayers) is 227 MB and the second one (vitaliihurin/devops-nginx-from-dockerfile) is 182.8 MB. The first one is bigger because I had to run ```sudo apt-get update``` and ```sudo apt-get install wget``` for downloading the picture manually inside the container.
