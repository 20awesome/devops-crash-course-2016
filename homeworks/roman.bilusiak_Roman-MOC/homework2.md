The TCP window scale option is an option to increase the receive window size allowed in Transmission Control Protocol above its former maximum value of **65,535 bytes**. This TCP option, along with several others, is defined in IETF RFC 1323 which deals with long fat networks.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_window_scale_option  

It is calculated as follows:
`Bandwidth-in-bits-per-second * Round-trip-latency-in-seconds = TCP window size in bits / 8 = TCP window size in bytes`

1,000,000,000 bps * 0.090 seconds = 90,000,000 bits / 8 = **11,250,000 Bytes**
